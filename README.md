# API Activities

## Overview
This repository contains a series of laboratory activities designed to introduce and enhance skills in FastAPI development.
## Laboratory Activities:

### Laboratory Activity #1: Introduction to FastAPI
This activity introduces FastAPI for API development while reinforcing Python programming skills where the user will create an code where the Endpoint name(/factorial/{starting_number})that is inside the API will compute the factorial of the inputted value in the endpoint. If the value inputted is 0, the endpoint should return {"result": false} while using a while loop.

### Laboratory Activity #2: Working with HTTP Actions and API Parameters
This activity explores API parameterization and HTTP methods by developing a **To-Do List API** using FastAPI where the user will implement CRUD operations (GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE) to manage tasks, ensuring proper validation, error handling and return a appropriate success and error messages for each request which are the CRUD operations. 

### Laboratory Activity #3: Working with JSON
This activity focuses on **JSON as a primary data format for APIs**, on how to parse, traverse, and convert Python data structures into JSON where the user will develop an API endpoint /detailed_post/{userID} that retrieves all posts of information of a given user. 

### Laboratory Activity #4: Advanced API Implementation
This activity focuses on advanced API development by implementing **versioning, authentication, and HTTP exception handling** in FastAPI where the user will create two API that has 2 different versions (apiv1 and apiv2) while also ensuring proper HTTP status codes and error handling. This API cannot be accessed without the API Key.

### Laboratory Activity #5: Deploying API in Cloud
This activity focuses on developing and deploying an API to a cloud platform where the user will create an new Github repository that contains a folder of the previous laboratory activity (Laboratory 4) and use that API to deploy in render.
