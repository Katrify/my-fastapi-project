# API Activities

## Overview
This repository contains a series of laboratory activities designed to introduce and enhance skills in FastAPI development.
## Laboratory Activities:

### Laboratory Activity #1: Introduction to FastAPI
This activity introduces FastAPI for API development while reinforcing Python programming skills. Students will create an API with a `/factorial/{starting_number}` endpoint that calculates the factorial of the given number using a while loop. If the input is `0`, the API should return `{"result": false}`. This hands-on exercise enhances logic-building and technical proficiency in API development.

### Laboratory Activity #2: Working with HTTP Actions and API Parameters
This activity explores API parameterization and HTTP methods by developing a **To-Do List API** using FastAPI. Students will implement CRUD operations (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`) to manage tasks, ensuring proper validation and error handling. The API should return appropriate success and error messages for each request. This hands-on exercise enhances understanding of RESTful API design and best practices.

### Laboratory Activity #3: Working with JSON
This activity focuses on **JSON as a primary data format for APIs**, teaching students how to parse, traverse, and convert Python data structures into JSON. Students will develop an API endpoint `/detailed_post/{userID}` that retrieves all posts of a given user along with associated comments. This exercise enhances skills in handling JSON data efficiently within FastAPI.

### Laboratory Activity #4: Advanced API Implementation
This activity focuses on advanced API development by implementing **versioning, authentication, and HTTP exception handling** in FastAPI. Students will create two API versions (`apiv1` and `apiv2`) while ensuring proper HTTP status codes and error handling. Additionally, environment variables will be used to manage API keys securely, reinforcing best practices in API security and deployment.

###Laboratory Activity #5: Deploying API in Cloud

This activity focuses on developing and deploying an API to a cloud platform. Students will deploy their Laboratory Activity #4 project to Render, following the provided deployment guide. This hands-on exercise helps students understand cloud deployment, service hosting, and API accessibility over the internet.
